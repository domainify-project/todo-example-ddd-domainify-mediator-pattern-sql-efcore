The example is a simple TODO application that is inspired by Scrum board, and it has been implemented by [Domainify version 1.0.1.6](https://www.nuget.org/packages/domainify/) and the persistence has been implemented based on SQL Server EF Core.  

The [Domainify Tutorial](https://domainify.dev/docs/tutorial/get-started) has been prepared in an example-oriented way. This repository is that example. So that, you can learn how to implement a project based on Domainify in action by the tutoril help.
